In addition to the default elements of a typical graphical user interface (GUI) like menu-, tool- and statusbar the QuickNXS program has a central area, which can be switch using the tab bar above, and several plot and option areas on the left and right side, always visible. Most users will work only with the "Overview" tab visible in the image above as it contains all valuable information about the current loaded dataset and the reduction parameters. 
The on the left and right areas can be customized in size and hold parameter entries for the reduction as well as the projection and reflectivity plot, most important for the extraction.
The other tabs, shown below, allow a parallel view on the 2D maps of all spin states in the active dataset as well as a preview of off-specular and GISANS scattering, motor/controller logs from the current file and a large plot area to compare different reflectivities extracted earlier.

<P>
Each of the plots has its own toolbar described in the plots section and shows one specific aspect of your dataset. 
 It is often important to look not only on one of these plots to analyze the data, so it is good to familiarize with what you see there.
 All options available in the toolbar are duplicated somewhere in the menus, to make it easier to find what you need.
 The most important actions have <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">keystrokes</SPAN> assigned to them for convenience. 
 The keys have been chosen to be accessible only with the right hand, so you can use them together with the mouse.
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Most GUI elements have a tool tip</SPAN> assigned, so you can always position the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mouse cursor</SPAN> over <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">any element to get a more detailed description</SPAN>, what it is used for.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> The Overview Tab</A>
</H1>
  This central tab shows information on the current dataset and the data reduction. A label at the top indicates the current file number, experiment ID, measurement type and the currently selected spin state.
  The two map plots below the label show the projected intensities on the horizontal and vertical detector axes (left) and on the time of flight and horizontal detector axes (right), in the same way as it is show during data acquisition.
  In the center some important parameters, extracted from the datafile header, are displayed. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">SANGLE-calc</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Counts ROI</SPAN> parameters also depends on the selected X- and Y- region and are thus not directly read from the file.
  The mouse can be used to define the X- and Y-region in this plots similar as in the projection areas described below.

<P>
At the bottom you can find the reduction table and an additional tab with a list of defined direct beam datasets.
  These tables show the parameters used for the respective intensity extractions.
  These parameters in the Data tab can be edited afterwards and will be applied directly to the reflectivity curve shown in the Reflectivity area.
  Directly above the table is a label showing the numbers of all defined direct beam runs and radio buttons to select the current datasets spin state shown in the Overview, projections and reflectivity plots.

<DD>A plot with the data of the loaded file projected on the detector X-axis. Black lines indicate the background region defined at the moment. The X-position is marked with a black line and the X-width with two red lines. The mouse can be used to change the background region and X-center using the left mouse button and set the X-width using the right mouse button.

<DT><STRONG>Y-Projection</STRONG></DT>
<DD>An equivalent projection on the detector Y-axis, showing the selected Y-region with green lines. The mouse can be used to change the Y-region using left clicks.

<DD>Shows all datasets already added to the reduction list (colored lines) and the currently selected one (black line labeled 'Active'). For datasets without fitting direct beam runs it shows intensity and background vs. wavelength. 
   Datasets in the reduction list can be scaled with the mouse wheel when at the right x-coordinates (faster scaling when CTRL is pressed while scrolling).
   Note that a dataset can be shown twice (as "Active" and with it's run number) when it is already in the reduction list and selected.

</H1>
  You can use the mouse wheel when your cursor is on top of a value entry to increase or decrease the according parameter. 
  This can be very convenient to see the result of e.g. changing the scaling factor for the current reflectivity. Holding down the CTRL key while scrolling increases the speed of the parameter changes.
  The same method can also be used to scale datasets in the reduction table, simply by moving the mouse at the curve in the reflectivity plot and scrolling with the mouse wheel.
